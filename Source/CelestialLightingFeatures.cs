namespace CelestialLighting;

// Runtime on/off switches for CelestialLighting's individual visual effects.
//
// In the shipped mod every switch is simply "on" and nothing flips it at runtime yet — the default
// value IS the shipped behaviour, so the effect works with neither of the two intended consumers
// present:
//   1. The planned settings screen (PR #23) will drive these from user-facing toggles.
//   2. The dev-only test harness flips them via RimWorldTestHarness's SetFeature step — bridged in
//      CelestialLighting.Probes' ProbeRegistration, so the shipped assembly still never references
//      the harness — letting a single scenario screenshot a colony with an effect off and then on
//      for an A/B visual diff, instead of eyeballing one frame and guessing what "before" looked
//      like.
//
// Kept as plain static bools rather than routed through ModSettings so the darkening/tint patches
// stay pure and offline-testable and take no dependency on a settings instance existing. Each flag
// gates exactly one effect; a flag turned off must fall back to the pre-feature behaviour (not to
// "no sky effect at all"), so that "off" is a faithful baseline of what the game looked like before
// that feature, which is what makes the harness A/B meaningful.

    // Civil-twilight persistence (linger warm tint through civil twilight after geometric sunset).
    // When off, Patch_TwilightColor falls back to the pre-feature glow-keyed-only warm band, so the

    // strength — GenCelestial.CurShadowStrength, which drives MatBases.SunShadow.color — down toward
    // the horizon as the solar-disk penumbra widens). When off, shadow strength keeps the raw
    // elevation-based intensity with no contrast falloff — crisp full-opacity shadows at every
    // elevation, exactly as before this feature — so "off" is a clean pre-feature baseline for the
    // harness A/B.

    // drives a faint, phase-and-altitude-scaled shadow through Patch_ShadowDirection/Strength once
    // the sun is down). When off, MoonPosition.ShadowForMap returns null, so both shadow patches fall
    // back to a shadowless night — exactly what the game showed before the moon existed (vanilla
    // renders no real moon shadow; its fake "moonlight" shadow is already suppressed). That makes
    // "off" the faithful pre-feature baseline for the harness A/B. Gating at ShadowForMap — the
    // single point both patches consume — keeps the two from ever disagreeing about whether a moon
    // shadow exists. The moon *phase/illumination* model itself is deliberately not gated: it is
    // foundational state (§7 night-radiance will read it) with no independent visible effect to
    // toggle yet.

    // glow floor with the sum of starlight + airglow + (real, phase-and-altitude-scaled) moonlight.
    // When off, the patch early-returns and leaves vanilla's glow untouched — the faithful
    // pre-feature baseline the harness A/B screenshots against. The individual source strengths and
    // the "true pitch-black" atmospheric-floor switch are separate runtime knobs on
    // NightRadianceSettings (bridged for the harness under NightAtmosphericGlowKey); this master flag
    // gates the whole effect on/off the way every other effect flag does.

    // Feature key bridging NightRadianceSettings.AtmosphericGlowEnabled — the "true pitch-black"
    // switch. Not a pre-feature baseline toggle (off gives a moonlight-only night, darker than
    // vanilla, not equal to it); it is a user setting (see NightRadianceSettings) exposed to the
    // harness so a probe scenario can flip it and watch the constant starlight+airglow floor drop
    // out of the night-radiance sum, leaving only moonlight.
