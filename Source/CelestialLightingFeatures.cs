namespace CelestialLighting;

// Runtime on/off switches for CelestialLighting's individual visual effects.
//
// In the shipped mod every switch is simply "on" and nothing flips it at runtime yet — the default
// value IS the shipped behaviour, so the effect works with neither of the two intended consumers
// present:
//   1. The planned settings screen (PR #23) will drive these from user-facing toggles.
//   2. The dev-only test harness flips them via RimWorldTestHarness's SetFeature step — bridged in
//      CelestialLighting.Probes' ProbeRegistration, so the shipped assembly still never references
//      the harness — letting a single scenario screenshot a colony with an effect off and then on
//      for an A/B visual diff, instead of eyeballing one frame and guessing what "before" looked
//      like.
//
// Kept as plain static bools rather than routed through ModSettings so the darkening/tint patches
// stay pure and offline-testable and take no dependency on a settings instance existing. Each flag
// gates exactly one effect; a flag turned off must fall back to the pre-feature behaviour (not to
// "no sky effect at all"), so that "off" is a faithful baseline of what the game looked like before
// that feature, which is what makes the harness A/B meaningful.

    // Feature key the harness/settings use to address CivilTwilightPersistence. Kept next to the

    // Civil-twilight persistence (linger warm tint through civil twilight after geometric sunset).
    // When off, Patch_TwilightColor falls back to the pre-feature glow-keyed-only warm band, so the
    // warm tint snaps off at geometric sunset exactly as it did before this feature existed — that
    // "off" state is the A/B baseline the harness screenshots against before flipping it on.

    // strength — GenCelestial.CurShadowStrength, which drives MatBases.SunShadow.color — down toward
    // the horizon as the solar-disk penumbra widens). When off, shadow strength keeps the raw
    // elevation-based intensity with no contrast falloff — crisp full-opacity shadows at every
    // elevation, exactly as before this feature — so "off" is a clean pre-feature baseline for the
    // harness A/B.
